     *
     * <p>The Comparator.compare() method is passed the byte arrays that are

     * href="{@docRoot}/../GettingStartedGuide/comparator.html"
     * target="_top">Getting Started Guide</a> for examples.</p>
     *
     * <p><em>WARNING:</em> There are several special considerations that must
     * be taken into account when implementing a comparator.<p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Comparator instances are shared by multiple threads and comparator
     *   methods are called without any special synchronization. Therefore,
     *   comparators must be thread safe.  In general no shared state should be
     *   used and any caching of computed values must be done with proper
     *   synchronization.</li>
     *
     *   <li>Because records are stored in the order determined by the
     *   Comparator, the Comparator's behavior must not change over time and
     *   therefore should not be dependent on any state that may change over
     *   time.  In addition, although it is possible to change the comparator
     *   for an existing database, care must be taken that the new comparator
     *   provides compatible results with the previous comparator, or database
     *   corruption will occur.</li>
     *
     *   <li>JE uses comparators internally in a wide variety of circumstances,
     *   so custom comparators must be sure to return valid values for any two
     *   arbitrary keys.  The user must not make any assumptions about the
     *   range of key values that might be compared. For example, it's possible
     *   for the comparator may be used against previously deleted values.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A special type of comparator is a <em>partial comparator</em>, which
     * compares a proper subset (not all bytes) of the key.  A partial
     * comparator allows uniquely identifying a record by a partial key value.
     * For example, the key could contain multiple fields but could uniquely
     * identify the record with a single field.  The partial comparator could
     * then compare only the single identifying field.  A query ({@link
     * Cursor#getSearchKey Cursor.getSearchKey}, for example) could then be
     * performed by passing a partial key that contains only the identifying
     * field.</p>
     *
     * <p>A partial comparator has limited value when used as a Btree
     * comparator. Instead of using a partial comparator, the non-identifying
     * fields of the key could be placed in the data portion of the key/data
     * pair.  This makes the key smaller, which normally provides better
     * performance.  A partial comparator is much more useful when used as a
     * duplicate comparator (see {@link #setDuplicateComparator
     * setDuplicateComparator}).</p>
     *
     * <p>However, if you do use a partial comparator as a Btree comparator, be
     * aware that you may not configure the database for duplicates (true may
     * not be passed to {@link #setSortedDuplicates setSortedDuplicates}).  In
     * a duplicate set, each key must have the same (identical bytes) key.  The
     * internal structure of JE's Btree cannot support duplicates with
     * non-identical keys, and cannot support specifying non-identical keys for
     * addressing the records in a duplicate set.</p>
     *
     * The comparator for an existing database will not be overridden unless
     * setOverrideBtreeComparator() is set to true.

     * By default, a byte by byte lexicographic comparison is used for
     * duplicate data items in a duplicate set.  To customize the comparison,
     * supply a different Comparator.
     *
     * <p>Note that there are two ways to set the comparator: by specifying the
     * class or by specifying a serializable object.  This method is used to
     * specify a Comparator class.  The comparator class must implement
     * java.util.Comparator and must have a public zero-parameter constructor.
     * JE will store the class name and instantiate the Comparator by class
     * name (using <code>Class.forName</code> and <code>newInstance</code>)
     * when subsequently opening the database.  Because the Comparator is
     * instantiated using its default constructor, it should not be dependent
     * on other constructor parameters.</p>
     *
     * <p>The Comparator.compare() method is passed the byte arrays that are
     * stored in the database. If you know how your data is organized in the
     * byte array, then you can write a comparison routine that directly
     * examines the contents of the arrays. Otherwise, you have to reconstruct
     * your original objects, and then perform the comparison.  See the <a
     * href="{@docRoot}/../GettingStartedGuide/comparator.html"
     * target="_top">Getting Started Guide</a> for examples.</p>
     *
     * <p><em>WARNING:</em> There are several special considerations that must
     * be taken into account when implementing a comparator.<p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Comparator instances are shared by multiple threads and comparator
     *   methods are called without any special synchronization. Therefore,
     *   comparators must be thread safe.  In general no shared state should be
     *   used and any caching of computed values must be done with proper
     *   synchronization.</li>
     *
     *   <li>Because records are stored in the order determined by the
     *   Comparator, the Comparator's behavior must not change over time and
     *   therefore should not be dependent on any state that may change over
     *   time.  In addition, although it is possible to change the comparator
     *   for an existing database, care must be taken that the new comparator
     *   provides compatible results with the previous comparator, or database
     *   corruption will occur.</li>
     *
     *   <li>JE uses comparators internally in a wide variety of circumstances,
     *   so custom comparators must be sure to return valid values for any two
     *   arbitrary keys.  The user must not make any assumptions about the
     *   range of key values that might be compared. For example, it's possible
     *   for the comparator may be used against previously deleted values.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>A special type of comparator is a <em>partial comparator</em>, which
     * is a comparator that compares a proper subset (not all bytes) of the
     * data.  A partial comparator allows uniquely identifying a record within
     * a duplicate set by a partial data value.  For example, the data could
     * contain multiple fields but could uniquely identify the record with a
     * single field.  The partial comparator could then compare only the single
     * identifying field.  A query ({@link Cursor#getSearchBoth
     * Cursor.getSearchBoth}, for example) could then be performed by passing a
     * partial data value that contains only the identifying field.</p>
     *
     * <p>When using a partial comparator, it is possible to update the data
     * for a duplicate record, as long as only the non-identifying fields in
     * the data are changed.  See {@link Cursor#putCurrent Cursor.putCurrent}
     * for more information.</p>
     *
     * The comparator for an existing database will not be overridden unless
     * setOverrideDuplicateComparator() is set to true.
